## **Task: End-to-End AI Pipeline for Customer Support Ticket Prioritization**

### **Objective**

Design, build, and deploy an AI-powered system that automatically classifies and prioritizes incoming customer support tickets by urgency and subject category. The solution should be production-ready, modular, and observable, supporting easy future improvements.

---

### **Step 1: Data Collection & Exploration**

**Goal:** Establish a pipeline to ingest, clean, and explore historical support ticket data.

* **1.1. Data Sourcing:**
  Obtain a dataset of past support tickets with fields like ticket ID, customer message, subject, timestamp, current priority, category, and resolution time.

  * *If such a dataset is unavailable, generate a synthetic set of at least 10,000 sample tickets with realistic messages and attributes.*

* **1.2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  * Analyze text length, frequency of categories, ticket arrival patterns, and resolution times.
  * Visualize category distribution, priority levels, and ticket volumes over time.
  * Identify data quality issues and document findings.

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**

**Goal:** Transform tickets into rich features for classification.

* **2.1. Text Features:**

  * Clean ticket messages (remove signatures, greetings, HTML, etc.).
  * Extract TF-IDF vectors for message and subject.
  * Calculate sentiment scores and urgency keywords (e.g., "ASAP", "urgent", "system down").
  * (Bonus: Extract entity features—product names, error codes—with an NLP model.)

* **2.2. Temporal & Meta Features:**

  * Ticket age (current - timestamp)
  * Hour of day, day of week (to capture business hour effects)
  * Ticket source/channel (if available)

* **2.3. Pipeline:**

  * Bundle all feature steps in a **scikit-learn Pipeline** (or similar), with logging.

### **Step 3: Model Building & Evaluation**

**Goal:** Build models for category and priority prediction.

* **3.1. Baseline Models:**

  * For **priority** (low/medium/high): Try Logistic Regression or DecisionTreeClassifier.
  * For **category** (multi-class): Try Multinomial Naive Bayes or RandomForestClassifier.

* **3.2. Advanced Models:**

  * Train at least one advanced model for each task (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, or fine-tuned BERT for text classification).
  * Evaluate using cross-validation, confusion matrix, precision/recall, and F1 score.

* **3.3. Hyperparameter Tuning:**

  * Use grid/random search for at least one model.

* **3.4. Interpretation:**

  * Analyze most important features (keywords, topics, entities).
  * Document how different features influence model predictions.

---

### **Step 4: Production-Ready Inference API**

**Goal:** Serve real-time predictions for new tickets.

* **4.1. Model Serialization:**

  * Export full preprocessing + model pipeline with joblib or similar.

* **4.2. API Development:**

  * Build a FastAPI (or Flask) endpoint `/predict-ticket` that accepts a ticket and returns:

    * Predicted priority (low/medium/high)
    * Predicted category (billing, technical, etc.)
    * Confidence scores
    * Key reasoning/features used for prediction (for transparency)
  * Add input validation, error handling, and structured logging.

* **4.3. Dockerization:**

  * Package the API as a Docker container with all dependencies.

---

### **Step 5: Monitoring & Feedback**

**Goal:** Monitor, track, and plan for continual improvement.

* **5.1. Logging:**

  * Log all incoming tickets, predictions, and response times.

* **5.2. Monitoring:**

  * Dashboard (Grafana, Streamlit, or Prometheus) to track:

    * Ticket volumes by predicted priority/category
    * Model drift (input feature changes over time)
    * Error rates and latency

* **5.3. Human-in-the-loop Feedback:**

  * Design a way for support agents to correct priority/category predictions.
  * Write a retraining plan that incorporates this feedback for periodic model improvement.

---

### **Step 6: Documentation & Review**

**Goal:** Create clear documentation and reflect for future improvements.

* **6.1. Technical Documentation:**

  * Data pipeline and cleaning steps
  * Feature engineering process
  * Model selection and evaluation
  * API usage with request/response samples
  * Monitoring and feedback plans

* **6.2. Reflection:**

  * Summarize strengths, limitations, and areas for next improvement (e.g., LLM integration, multilingual support, topic modeling, active learning).

---

### **Deliverables**

* Clean, commented source code (organized in modules)
* Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
* Dockerfile and FastAPI/Flask app code
* OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
* Monitoring/dashboard code
* Written summary and next steps document

---

### **Stretch Goals (Optional, Advanced)**

* Integrate LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) for zero-shot or few-shot classification.
* Deploy auto-prioritization in a real queueing system (simulated or real).
* Add multi-language support for non-English tickets.
* Implement escalation triggers for high-urgency tickets.

**This task covers:**

* Data engineering & NLP
* Feature extraction
* Model building for classification
* Robust API and Docker deployment
* Monitoring, feedback loop, and transparency
